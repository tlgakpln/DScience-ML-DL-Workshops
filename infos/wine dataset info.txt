Alcohol: The alcohol content of the wine (measured in percentage).

Malic Acid: The amount of malic acid in the wine (measured in g/L).

Ash: The amount of ash in the wine (measured in g/L).

Alcalinity of Ash: The alkalinity of the ash (measured in pH).

Magnesium: The amount of magnesium in the wine (measured in mg/L).

Total Phenols: The total amount of phenolic compounds in the wine.

Flavanoids: The amount of flavanoids in the wine.

Nonflavanoid Phenols: The amount of nonflavanoid phenols in the wine.

Proanthocyanins: The amount of proanthocyanins in the wine.

Color Intensity: The color intensity of the wine (measured in optical density).

Hue: The hue of the wine.

OD280/OD315 of Diluted Wines: The optical density of wines at 280/315 nm.

Proline: The amount of proline in the wine (measured in mg/L).

Flavanoids: Flavanoids contribute significantly to the typical taste and aroma of wines.
Therefore, the "Flavanoids" column may have a high importance in distinguishing between wine types.

Total Phenols: Total phenols are compounds that influence the color, aroma, and flavor profile of wines.
This column could also be crucial in differentiating between wine types.

OD280/OD315 of Diluted Wines: This optical density column provides information about the color and concentration of wines.
It may play a significant role in determining wine types.

Proline: The amount of proline can impact the taste and texture of wines.
Hence, the "Proline" column might have a decisive role in classifying wine types.

These columns are likely to be important features for predicting wine types. However, when training your model,
it's essential to evaluate all features and consider techniques such as feature selection or dimensionality reduction
to achieve better results. Additionally, using methods like cross-validation to assess your model's performance and
fine-tuning it for optimal results is crucial.

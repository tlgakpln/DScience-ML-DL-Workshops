These columns contain measurements of various features related to cell nuclei, and they are essential for distinguishing
between benign and malignant breast cancer tumors. When building a predictive model, these features are typically used
to classify tumors as either malignant or benign based on their characteristics. Proper feature selection and model
evaluation techniques are important for achieving accurate results in breast cancer diagnosis.
